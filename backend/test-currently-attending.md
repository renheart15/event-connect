# How to Test "Currently Attending" Feature

## Step 1: Create an Active Event
1. Go to Organizer Dashboard
2. Create a new event with these times:
   - **Date**: Today
   - **Start Time**: 1 hour ago (e.g., if it's 2:00 PM now, set start to 1:00 PM)
   - **End Time**: 1 hour from now (e.g., if it's 2:00 PM now, set end to 3:00 PM)
   - **Make sure to set it as "Public"**

## Step 2: Join the Event as a Participant
1. Go to Participant Dashboard or Public Events page
2. Find the active event (should show status as "active")
3. Click "Join Event" or scan the QR code
4. Complete the check-in process

## Step 3: Verify "Currently Attending"
1. After joining, go to Participant Dashboard
2. Check the "Currently Attending" section
3. You should now see the active event listed there

## Why This Was Empty Before:
- All existing events in the database are either completed or upcoming
- No participant had joined any active events
- The system was working correctly, just no active attendance records existed

## Technical Details:
The `getCurrentlyAttending()` function filters attendance records by:
```javascript
return myAttendance.filter(attendance =>
  attendance.checkInTime &&           // Must be checked in
  !attendance.checkOutTime &&         // Must not be checked out
  attendance.event?.status === 'active' // Event must be currently active
);
```

This ensures only genuinely active attendances are shown.
