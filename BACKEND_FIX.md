# Rate Limit Fix Applied

The live monitor was encountering "429 Too Many Requests" errors due to restrictive rate limiting. This has been fixed:

## Changes Made:
1. **Backend**: Increased rate limit from 100 to 1000 requests per 15 minutes
2. **Frontend**: Improved error handling for rate limits and JSON parsing errors
3. **Frontend**: Increased refresh interval from 30s to 45s to be more backend-friendly

## To Apply the Fix:
1. **Restart the backend server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the backend (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart:
   npm run backend
   ```

2. **Frontend will automatically work** with the updated error handling

The live monitor should now work without rate limit issues!

## Rate Limits Now:
- **Before**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **After**: 1000 requests per 15 minutes  
- **Refresh Rate**: 45 seconds (down from 30s)

This allows for approximately 20 requests per minute sustained usage, well within limits.
